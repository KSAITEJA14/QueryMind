# QueryMind: A Semantic Search Engine for Research Papers

QueryMind is a semantic search application designed to retrieve and rank research papers from the Arxiv dataset based on user queries. The system uses **Google Cloud Platform** services like Vertex AI, BigQuery, and Cloud Storage to handle embeddings, metadata, and search efficiently.

---

## Features
- **Vector Similarity Search**: Uses Vertex AI Matching Engine to find the top-k nearest neighbors in the embedding space.
- **Metadata Querying**: Fetches detailed metadata (title, abstract, authors, and categories) of the nearest neighbors from BigQuery.
- **Interactive UI**: Displays the search results with a clean, scrollable design using React.js.

---

## Prerequisites
1. **Google Cloud Platform**:
   - Vertex AI for vector similarity search.
   - BigQuery for metadata storage and querying.
   - Cloud Storage for embedding storage.
2. **Local Setup**:
   - Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for managing the project environment.
   - Node.js for running the frontend application.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VSMourya/QueryMind.git
cd querymind
```

### 2. Setup Google Cloud Credentials
Create a file named `creds.py` in the `src` folder and fill it with the following structure (below are dummy values):
```python
PROJECT_ID = "querymind"
REGION = "us-east1"
DEPLOYED_INDEX_ID = "first_deploy_1733045330981"
DATASET_ID = "vectordata"
TABLE_ID = "arxiv-metadata"
ENDPOINT_ID = "8068788071234561520"
INDEX_ENDPOINT_NAME = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{REGION}/indexEndpoints/{ENDPOINT_ID}"
```
> Replace the above values with your actual **Google Cloud Platform** configurations.

---

### 3. Setup Conda Environment
Create and activate a conda environment named `Querymind`:
```bash
conda create --name Querymind python=3.10 -y
conda activate Querymind
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies using `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Dependencies include:
- `torch>=2.0.0`
- `sentence-transformers>=2.2.2`
- `google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.33.0`
- `google-cloud-bigquery>=3.11.4`

---

### 5. Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the `interactive-search-bar` folder and install frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

---

### 6. Run the Application
Open **two terminals** and activate the `Querymind` conda environment in both:
1. **Frontend**: Run the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This starts the frontend server at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Backend**: Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python3 src/app.py
   ```
   The backend server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Workflow

### Backend Components
1. **Vector Search**:
   - Uses Vertex AI Matching Engine to retrieve the nearest neighbors for a query embedding.
   - Top-k results are returned based on vector similarity.
2. **Metadata Querying**:
   - Retrieves metadata (title, abstract, authors, and categories) of nearest neighbors using BigQuery.

### Frontend Features
- Clean UI design with a **search bar** and **scrollable results display**.
- Each result contains:
  - Title of the paper.
  - Abstract summary (generated by Gemini LLM).
  - Distance (relevance score).
- A **Clear** button allows users to reset the results for new searches.

---

## Example Usage
- **Search**: Input a query such as "Applications of AI in healthcare."
- **Results**: The app retrieves the most relevant research papers and displays them in the UI.
- **Clear**: Reset the results for a new query.

- **Google Cloud Platform** for providing scalable backend services.
- **Sentence Transformers** for efficient embedding generation.
- **React.js** for the modern, responsive UI.
